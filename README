Joonas likes redundancy. So Joonas, being frustrated with having even minute
long downtimes on his home DSL connection after the dog had tripped on some
cables, wrote a script to provide redundant connectivity. Here it is.

At Joonas' setup, it monitors three connections (2x DSL, 1x 3G) and chooses
the best one. When the better connection resumes after the break, it's
switched back but only after 10 successful ping runs.

It's a hack, not beautiful at all. It works. Let me know if you use it.
