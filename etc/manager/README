Varabitti

Our solution is to use ip rule to have multiple default routes.
Monitor.py uses ping to monitor each of the connections simultaneously
and switches the active default route. All default routes are, however,
configured all the time. We use netfilter to keep the connections marked
so they end up in the correct interface.

# ip rule add priority 5000 table main 
# ip rule add priority 5001 fwmark 1 table option 
# ip rule add priority 5002 fwmark 2 table huawei 
# ip rule add priority 5003 fwmark 3 table gprs 

We also use ppp ip-up.d and ip-down.d scripts to generate some rules dynamically:

# ip rule add from $LOCALIP table $TABLE
# ip route add default dev $IFACE table $TABLE

For full code see etc/ppp/ip-up.d/varabitti and etc/ppp/ip-down.d/varabitti.

This is how it looks like in action:
  joneskoo@hansu:~$ ip rule
  0:  from all lookup local 
  5000:   from all lookup main 
  5001:   from all fwmark 0x1 lookup option 
  5002:   from all fwmark 0x2 lookup huawei 
  5003:   from all fwmark 0x3 lookup gprs 
  6100:   from 85.76.67.xxx lookup huawei 
  6200:   from 85.76.207.xxx lookup gprs 
  7000:   from 85.76.102.xxx lookup option 
  32766:  from all lookup main 
  32767:  from all lookup default 

Table names can be configured in /etc/iproute/rt_tables like this:
  6200 gprs
  6100 huawei
  5000 option

The modified dhclient-script for use with DHCP is also provided at
etc/dhcp3/dhclient-script.

switch.sh changes the default route for the local host and changes the
varabitti mangle table so new connections are marked with the new preferred
route mark.

For help with setting up netfilter marking to implement similar default
route preferences, here's some lines I used:

  iptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -j CONNMARK --restore-mark
  iptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -m mark ! --mark 0x0 -j ACCEPT 
  iptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -d 172.20.100.0/24 -j ACCEPT 
  iptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -d 192.168.69.0/24 -j ACCEPT 
  iptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -j varabitti 
  iptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -j CONNMARK --save-mark
  iptables -t mangle -N varabitti
  iptables -t mangle -A varabitti -j MARK --set-mark 1
